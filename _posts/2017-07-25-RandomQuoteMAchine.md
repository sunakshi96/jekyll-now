Hi, I am Sunakshi, a Computer Science major from India. I am currently in my final year of college and expect to graduate in May 2018. I am a coding enthusiast, an avid reader, a cartoonist. In my free time I learn new technologies.
I've spent my last summer at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, working as a software engineering intern.

Recently I started to learn fullstack webdevelopment at freeCodeCamp. I plan to blog my progress in web development which is mainly due to the fact that I just couldn’t find the time to spare amongst other pressing commitments. 

Now that I’ve freed up some time on several fronts, I think it is time to start blogging. Before jumping to jekyll-now, I first thought to make a simple personal website, but after reading about the static websites and saw how influencial and simple the jekyll-powered websites looked, I finally convinced myself to exploit the power of jekyll and forked the Jekyll Now on Github.
